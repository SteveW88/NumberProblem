# Creating Number classes

You will be creating three classes. The first class is called Number, which supports three operations: 

“display”, “==”, and “+”.

1. display: This operation displays the Number itself in its original form (I will explain later).

2. ==: This operation returns true if two Numbers are numerically the same.

3. +: This operation adds the number itself with another number and returns a third number 

whose numeric value is equal to the sum of the numeric values of the former two.

The second class is called Integer, which is self-explanatory.  The third class is Fraction, which is 

represented by its numerator and denominator (both are integers).

Integer and Fraction are the only two kinds of Numbers. Naturally, they support all three operations of 

Number. For a Fraction, it needs to be displayed in its original form. That is, 2/4 has to be displayed as 

“2/4”, not “1/2” or “0.5”. 

Please implement these three classes and write a test(s) to make sure the solution works as expected.
